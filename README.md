- ðŸ”­ I'm an Applied Mathematician and Computer Scientist, currently working as a Research Intern at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian advised by Dr. Rafael MartÃ­nez-Galarza, collaborating with Drs. Alexander Caicedo-Dorado and Raffaele D'Abrusco. We are exploring the potential of unsupervised machine learning methods to classify sources detected by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. I hold my B.Sc. from Universidad del Rosario (2022). My research interests are broad and include the intersection between machine learning and astrophysics, machine learning methods development, quantum computing algorithms and mathematical modeling for cognitive sciences.


- ðŸŒŽ I am also very interested in social impact, particularly using the skills that I have gained in my research and scientific interests. I work as a Data Analyst at Propel, a social organization that boosts educational nonprofits in Latin America through a digital transformation journey. I was part of the Youth Ambassadors program in 2017, a leadership program managed by the U.S. Embassy in Colombia and the U.S. Department of State. I am a LALA (Latin America Leadership Academy) Alumni, and I have been involved since 2019 with their mission of empowering young leaders across Latin America.
