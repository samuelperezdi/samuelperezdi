Hi! I'm an Applied Mathematician and Computer Scientist, currently serving as a Research Fellow at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Center for Astrophysics l Harvard & Smithsonian. I am also part of AstroAI. I hold my B.Sc. from Universidad del Rosario (Colombia). 

My research focuses on leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for scientific discovery. My focus lies at the intersection of machine learning and (astro)physics. I am interested in foundation models for science, interpretability, and robustness.
