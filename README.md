I am an Applied Mathematician and Computer Scientist, currently serving as a Research Fellow at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Center for Astrophysics l Harvard & Smithsonian. I am working on using machine learning methods to predict X-ray activity from rotating stars. I hold my B.Sc. from Universidad del Rosario (2022). 

I have a wide range of research interests, primarily centered around machine learning for scientific advancement. My focus lies at the intersection of machine learning and astrophysics. I am also interested in machine learning methods development, quantum algorithms, and computational cognitive models.

In 2022, I was a Research Intern at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, where I worked under the guidance of Dr. Rafael Martínez-Galarza and in collaboration with Drs. Alexander Caicedo-Dorado and Raffaele D'Abrusco. Our research explored the potential of unsupervised machine learning methods for classifying sources detected by the Chandra X-ray Observatory.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I am passionate about social impact and leveraging my skills for positive change. In 2017, I participated in the Youth Ambassadors program, a leadership initiative managed by the U.S. Embassy in Colombia and the U.S. Department of State.  I am a LALA (Latin American Leadership Academy) Alumni, actively supporting their mission to empower young leaders throughout the region since 2019. In 2021 and 2022, I worked as a Data Analyst in Propel, a social organization focused on fostering a community of technology-driven social leaders in Latin America.
